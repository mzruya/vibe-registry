# work - Multi-Project Git Worktree Manager

## Purpose

A CLI tool for managing git worktrees across multiple projects. Enables parallel development on multiple branches without stashing or switching branches in place. All worktrees are stored in a central location for easy management.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `work` | Interactive project/worktree switcher with fuzzy search |
| `work <branch>` | Create worktree and cd into it (auto-registers project) |
| `work ls` | List worktrees for current project with PR/build status |
| `work rm [branch]` | Delete worktree (current worktree if no arg) |
| `work prune` | Clean up merged worktrees across ALL projects |
| `work add [path]` | Register a git repository as a project |

## Storage Layout

```
~/.config/work/
└── projects.nuon              # List of registered projects [{name, path}]

~/.work/worktrees/
├── web/                       # Project name (from directory basename)
│   ├── mz-feature-1/          # Full git worktree checkout
│   └── mz-bugfix/
└── zenpayroll/
    └── mz-other-feature/
```

## Behavior

### `work` (Interactive Switcher)

Two-level drill-down navigation:

1. **Outside a project**: Shows project list first
   - Displays: project name, worktree count, path
   - Select a project → enters worktree view

2. **Inside a project**: Shows worktree list first
   - Displays: branch name, age, PR number, PR state (open/merged/closed), build status (✓/✗/○)
   - Press ESC → goes back to project list
   - "main" option always present to return to main repo

### `work <branch>` (Create Worktree)

1. If not in a registered project, auto-registers current git repo
2. Fetches `origin/main`
3. Creates worktree:
   - If branch exists locally → uses existing branch
   - If branch doesn't exist → creates from `origin/main`
4. Sets up `.claude/settings.local.json` with session name
5. Runs `git checkout` in background for faster startup
6. cd's into the worktree

### `work ls` (List Worktrees)

Non-interactive list showing:
- Branch name
- Age (e.g., "2 days ago")
- PR number and state (from GitHub CLI)
- Build status with check counts (e.g., "✓ 5/5")
- Current worktree marker

### `work rm [branch]` (Delete Worktree)

- If no branch specified and inside a worktree, deletes current worktree
- Warns if branch still exists on remote (unmerged PR)
- Auto cd's to main repo if deleting current worktree
- Removes both worktree directory and local branch

### `work prune` (Cleanup)

Operates across ALL registered projects:

1. For each project with worktrees:
   - Fetches from origin (updates remote branch info)
   - For each worktree:
     - If branch no longer exists on remote → considered merged
     - If has local uncommitted/unpushed changes → skip with warning
     - Otherwise → remove worktree and local branch
2. Shows summary: "Pruned N worktree(s) across M project(s)"

### `work add [path]` (Register Project)

- Registers git repo at path (defaults to current directory)
- Project name derived from directory basename
- Validates it's a git repository
- Prevents duplicate registrations

## Project Detection

A "current project" is detected by checking (in order):
1. Is pwd inside `~/.work/worktrees/<project>/`? → that project
2. Is pwd inside any registered project's main repo path? → that project
3. Otherwise → null (not in a project)

## Integration Points

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Fetches PR info (number, state, status checks)
- **mise**: Auto-trusts config files when entering worktrees
- **Claude Code**: Sets up session name in `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Data Format

`projects.nuon` (Nushell structured data):
```nuon
[
  {name: "web", path: "/Users/user/workspace/web"},
  {name: "zenpayroll", path: "/Users/user/workspace/zenpayroll"}
]
```

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Nushell's `input list --fuzzy` for interactive selection
- PR info fetched in parallel (`par-each`) for performance
- Worktree creation uses `--no-checkout` + background checkout for speed
- All paths use `path expand` to handle `~` properly
